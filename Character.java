/*
 * This is the main class that every entity currently is descended from
 * It contains the majority of methods that generally everyone would have to do(take damage, move, and not be down)
 * also contains the abstract attack which is defined differently for each type of character
 * also contains the values of health(hitpoints), strength(planned to be incorporated into damage calc),
 * speed(used is melee test, and to see how far the character can move), dodge(used to avoid attacks),
 * armour(used to soak attacks(i realized while typing these comments its meant to be spelled "armor" lol)),
 * accuracy(used in ranged attack calculations), and initiative(used to determine when this character is allowed to move)
