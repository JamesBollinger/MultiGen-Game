# MultiGen-Game
This is designed for the creation of the game  

So I think that we could use this readMe to easily to set tasks and other stuff that we want to get done  

I just think it would be an easy way of looking at stuff  
We should probably still use the google docs for brainstorming new general ideas, leave this for specific code stuff  

NOTE (Jan 15th, VC): You know what I just realized? "Character" is the name of an existing wrapper class in Java.  
Actually, this may be irrelevant, since we're not going to be using the wrapper class.  
But it got me thinking as to whether we should rename the Character.java class.
